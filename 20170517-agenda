Agenda

1. Update EC with demo
2. EC feedback on portal work so far
3. Discuss high-level architecture topics

Notes: 

-Future work: reporting- users will want to see reports (based on pre-written SPARQL queries) for things like: "Return a list of all the software applications that can read XYZ file format"

-Future work: trust- identifying trusted users

-Future work: developing use cases and workflows (ex. catalog an inventory of software)

We need to guide people carefully, provide examples, avoid jargon in UI

We may consider handling subclasses separately

Is there built-in reporting within Flask?
